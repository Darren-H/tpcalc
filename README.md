# _TerraPass Carbon Emissions Calculator_

## Build concerns 
I based the build concerns for this project on http://davidtucker.net/articles/automating-with-grunt/
note: This list can and should be edited/ammeded and is not 100% fufilled
- lint JavaScript code 
- compile my SASS/Compass code to a standard file that includes the Bootstrap framework.
- delete the contents of the build directory before I initiate a new build process. 
- utilize Browserify to manage dependencies between different logic groups of my JavaScript code using CommonJS modules and compile that to a single JavaScript file that I can load for my site. 
- create a build then launch the preview server 
- be able to automatically compile my SASS code or my 
- minify images that are included in my static site after the site is built but before it is deployed to the host. 
- remove empty lines from HTML and XML files which are generated by Wintersmith.
- automatically package JavaScript code with Browserify when any of those files in my work directory change
- be able to automatically compress and minify my JavaScript when building 
- minify all CSS files that are compiled from the SASS code before deployment
- Nice to haves:
- be able to utilize a hash of my CSS/JS files' filename to help ensure that the viewers of my site don't end up loaded an older cached version of these files. 
- be able to deploy to both a staging or production environment
- be able to automatically change the version number and tag production releases in my git repository. 

## Tech Stack
- NPM - Package Mangagement

- numerals.js and JS-Quantities for number formatting

## Project Setup

### Install node
- If you're using the excellent homebrew package manager, you can install node with one command: 
	brew install node
- Or follow the directions here: http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs

	curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
More info here: http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm

### Install gulp
	npm install -g gulp

### Install dependencies
	npm install

## Run the project locally for development
	gulp server
Project will be running at port 3000 on localhost
gulp-livereload is handling the browser reload. It only works with this script:
http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86180-how-do-i-add-the-script-tag-manually-
I have no fucking clue how these two things work together (in other words: magic)

## Testing
Test suite is built with Jasmine and the test runner is Karma
	gulp test

## Deploying
	gulp build
Produces a complete project in the /dist directory
